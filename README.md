# Quick installations for different tools on linux systems ðŸš€

Every installation line is linked to a raw \*.sh file in this repository that runs different neccessary steps.  
I'm not the owner of the ultimately destinations and the commands are only acting as intermediaries.  

__The respective raw \*.sh-files are linked for every tool - so you can check all the destinations before running the installations.__  

It can not hurt to make an update, upgrade and reboot before and after the installations:  
``sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo reboot now``  

Have fun! ðŸ˜Ž
