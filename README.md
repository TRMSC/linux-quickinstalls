# Quick installations for linux systems 🚀

Every installation line is linked to a raw \*.sh file in this repository that runs different neccessary steps.  
I'm not the owner of the ultimately destinations and the commands are only acting as intermediaries.  

__The respective raw \*.sh-files are linked for every tool - so you can check all the destinations before running the installations.__  

It can not hurt to make an update, upgrade and reboot before and after the installations:  
``sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo reboot now``  

Have fun! 😎

> RPiPlay __```works only on Raspberry Pi OS Buster (Legacy)```__ and [not on Bullseye yet](https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay/issues/294).  
> You can choose __Buster light or the desktop version__.

Get the latest buster versions (light and desktop) on [raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/). If you use the Raspberry Pi Imager you can find the buster versions by choosing "Raspberry Pi OS (other)".  

> This installation was successfully tested on __```Raspberry 3b+ and 4b```__

__Installation:__  
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRMSC/linux-quickinstalls/main/rpitv.sh | bash
